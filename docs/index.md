## 🎓 Academic Background

I am a Full Professor in Artificial Intelligence at [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr), conducting research within the [LIG Laboratory](http://www.liglab.fr/). I lead the [Marvin Team](http://marvin.imag.fr), which specializes in automated planning, machine learning, and robotics.

From 2006 to 2013, I was an Associate Professor at Paris Descartes University, where I also served as Vice-President of the Board of Directors between 2011 and 2013.

## 🧠 Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence**, with a particular focus on:

- 🔧 **Automated Planning and Scheduling**
- 🤖 **Autonomous Robotics**
- 🧠 **Machine Learning**
- 🧑‍💻 **Human-Robot Interaction**

### 📌 Focus on Automated Planning

Automated planning is a core area of AI concerned with generating sequences of actions to achieve specific goals from a given initial state. It is a critical component of intelligent systems such as robots, virtual assistants, and mission-critical applications.

A classical planner typically receives:
- a formal description of the **initial state**,
- a **goal** specification,
- and a set of available **actions** (often written in STRIPS or PDDL).

The planner's task is to find a valid sequence of actions that transforms the initial state into one that satisfies the goal. Most classical planners assume discrete time, deterministic outcomes, and full observability.

## 🤝 Collaborations & Supervision

I regularly supervise PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate projects. I am involved in several national and European research projects (ANR, H2020), focusing on explainable AI, robotics, and intelligent human-machine collaboration.
