## PDDL4J

PDDL4J is a software library under [LGPL license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html)  embedding Artificial Intelligence algorithms to find solutions for planning problems, that is to say time organized actions to achieve a goal. Solutions to planning problems are “todo lists” named plan representing operational features of actions like who, how, where, when and what to do. The code of the library is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pellierd/pddl4j).

PDDL4J is a suite of solvers useful for decision problems that can be solved by a sequence of actions (plan). It is based on a declarative approach: the user states a decision problem in PDDL (Planning Domain Description language and PDDL4J generates possible solutions. No programming language and/or background is required. PDDL4J has lot of application fields like can be use in many industrial fields as smart homes/data/cities, autonomous systems and robotics, logistics, business processes etc.
